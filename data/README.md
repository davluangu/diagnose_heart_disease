### Instructions: 
- There should be a folder named `train` in this folder. 
- It should be the unzipped training data set from kaggle.
- Don't worry too much about the folder structure within `train`. 
- The import stage does a recursive search for .dcm files inside `train`.
- Everything inside `data/` is being `.gitignore`'d
